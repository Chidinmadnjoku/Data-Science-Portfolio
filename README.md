### Compilation of Projects

## Project 1: Applied Data Analysis and Visualization of Offences in the UK for 2014 and 2015

* Downloaded, refined and integrated datasets from a twenty-four month period of Crown Prosecution Service Case Outcomes by Principal Offence Categoryfrom the data.gov.uk website (link: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/89d0aef9-e2f9-4d1a-b779-5a33707c5f2c/crown-prosecution-service-case-outcomes-by-principal-offence-category-data).

* With the use of Python, data analytics tools and techniques related to descriptive and predictive analytics were applied on the integrated dataset, a prediction model using one linear regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique were developed.

* Prepared a report containing: a.Definition of, at least, two different hypothesis based on the currentdataset; b. Explained and justified cleaning / integration techniques used in the dataset; c. Analysed and interpretated results using descriptive analytics; d.Implemented a prediction model using one linear regression technique, one clustering technique and one classification technique; e. Critically reviewed the data analytics tools and techniques used. Analysed the effectiveness of the techniques used, discussed alternative solutions and compare strengths and weakness between them; f. Critically reviewed the visualisation tools used, analysed the effectiveness of the visualisation tools used, discussed alternative solutions and compared strengths and weakness between them.

## Project 2: Business Case Study
## Customer Acquisition and Retention improvement Using Data Analysis Techniques

* Chose four data analysis techniques (Data Collection, Data Processing, Data Cleaning and Data Management), analysed and evaluated them.

* Discussed the theoretical aspect of these techniques and the tools that can be used

* Critically analysed and evaluate the applications of these techniques

* Reviewed the available commercial and open-source data analysis software appropriate for the business issues.

* Selected a business case with the data analysis requirements, synthesised a plan for addressing the probelms with the suggestions of the technique and the available software.
